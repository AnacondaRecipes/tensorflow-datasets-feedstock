Your temporary work directory is at `.cursor/tmp` in the feedstock repository.

When you need to download a file to work on it, or any work which would generate temporary files, always do it in the temporary directory.

Always write down all you do, i.e., all your actions and thoughts, your planned future actions, as well as the response from MCP tools, in a Markdown file called `scratchpad.md` in the temporary directory.
Consult your scratchpad periodically to remind you of what you did previously and what happened.
