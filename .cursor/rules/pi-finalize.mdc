1. Create an entry in `worklog.md` in the `.cursor` directory
    - Create a headline with:
        - The date in ISO format
        - The PI Cursor version string in `.cursor/rules/VERSION`
        - The versions of the package we're updating from and to
    - Summarize the important points of `scratchpad.md`
    - Do not mention links to files on the local system, these are transient and will disappear
    - Do not repeat the steps from the rules you used, these are known

2. Delete the `.cursor/tmp` directory in the feedstock repository.
